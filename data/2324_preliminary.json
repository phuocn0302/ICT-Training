        "explanation": "In Linux/Unix OSs, the \"jobs\" command lists the background processes of the current terminal session or shell.\nAfter starting a command or program in a terminal or shell, you can press \"Ctrl+Z\" to pause it and move to the background. You can then run \"jobs\" to view the list of background tasks.\n- Option A: \"cat\" is used to concatenate or display file content and is not related to background tasks.\n- Option B: \"vim\" is a popular text editor and is not related to background tasks, either.\n- Option D: \"bg\" is used to resume paused background tasks, not to view them.\n\"jobs\" typically displays a list of background tasks, including their job IDs, status (running or stopped), and associated commands. This information allows you to decide whether to resume a background task using the \"fg\" command or terminate it using the \"kill\" command.\nTherefore, C is the correct answer. The \"jobs\" command is the most suitable option for viewing background tasks of the current shell. It is a valuable tool for managing and controlling these background processes.",

        "explanation": "Before installing openGauss, you need to use a dedicated tool to check the environment to ensure that the OS environment and configuration are proper. gs_checkos is used to check the OS. It provides the following functions:\nChecking the OS version: Ensure that the OS version is compatible with openGauss.\nChecking kernel parameters: Some kernel parameters are critical to the performance and stability of a database. This tool checks whether these parameters are properly set.\nChecking the disk space and I/O configuration: A database requires a large amount of disk space and efficient I/O operations. This tool can be used to check whether the disk space is sufficient and whether the I/O configuration is optimal.\nChecking the network configuration: A database requires a stable network connection. This tool checks the network configuration to ensure that no firewall or other network settings interfere with the normal running of the database.\nChecking other dependent software: openGauss may depend on other software packages or libraries. gs_checkos can ensure that these dependencies are correctly installed.\nTherefore, the answer is A.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The logical replication features of openGauss are described as follows:\n(1) Primary-primary deployment is supported. Logical replication allows two-way synchronization between primary and standby instances. Any node can function as the primary node to provide services or function as the standby node to receive data from other primary node.\n(2) Binary logs are converted into logical SQL statements. Logical replication parses binary WALs of the primary node, converts them into logical SQL statements, and replays these logical SQL statements on the standby node to implement data synchronization.\n(3) Table-level replication is supported. Different from traditional instance-level or database-level replication, logical replication of openGauss implements table-level data replication and synchronizes only data changes in specified tables.\nBased on the three characteristics, the answer is D. Logical replication is more flexible than physical replication and can implement data synchronization between cross-platform database instances.",

The above options are analyzed as follows:\n- Option A: A simple password is easy to crack and insecure. Do not use simple passwords. Instead, set a complex password that is difficult to guess.\n- Option B: Allowing any IP address to log in is actually insecure because it allows access from anywhere without proper restrictions. Attackers may use this to attempt unauthorized access.\n- Option C: Enabling SSL/TLS encrypted connection significantly improves security. The SSL/TLS protocol is used to ensure that the communication between a client and a server is encrypted, thereby protecting transmitted data from being stolen or tampered with. This is an important measure to ensure network communication security.\n- Option D: Disabling password policy check weakens account security. A password policy ensures that a strong password is set.

            "A. A refers to atomicity. Operations in a transaction are either all successful or all failed.",
            "B. C refers to consistency. The system status can only be the status before the transaction or after the transaction is successful. No inconsistent intermediate status can occur.",

            "D. D refers to durability. The status of a successful transaction can be maintained even if the machine is powered off."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The ACID feature of database transactions is analyzed as follows:\nA refers to atomicity. Operations in a transaction are either all successful or all failed. This is true. Atomicity ensures that all operations within a transaction are either successful or failed. If operations are failed, the transaction is rolled back to the state before it starts.\nC refers to consistency. The system status can only be the status before the transaction or after the transaction is successful. No inconsistent intermediate status can occur. This is also true. Consistency requires that a transaction must change a database from one consistent state to another consistent state. Before and after a transaction, the database integrity is not damaged.\nI refers to availability. The database system must provide the highest availability for database execution to ensure that most transactions can be successfully executed. This is false. In the ACID feature, I refers to isolation instead of availability. Isolation requires that concurrent transactions be isolated from each other. Operations within a transaction and data being operated must be blocked and cannot be viewed by other transactions.\nD refers to durability. The status of a successful transaction can be maintained even if the machine is powered off. This is true. Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, the result is permanent. Even if the system breaks down or fails, the database can restore the data to the state when the transaction ends.\nTherefore, the answer is C. Actually, I in the ACID feature represents isolation.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "About the separation of duties in openGauss:\n- Option A: Database administrators (DBAs), application developers, and system administrators have the same permissions and responsibilities. This is false. Based on the separation of duties, permissions and responsibilities should be assigned to different roles or users to prevent a single role or user from having excessive permissions.\n- Option B: The responsibilities of database management, data security, and database audit log viewing and management are assigned to different roles or users. This is true. The separation of duties in openGauss clearly proposes three key roles: system administrator, security administrator, and audit administrator. A system administrator grants permissions to created users. A security administrator creates data management users. An audit administrator audits the operations performed by the security administrator, system administrator, and common users. In this way, the responsibilities of database management, data security, and audit log viewing and management are clearly assigned to different roles or users.\n- Option C: The responsibilities between database instances, databases, and tablespaces are separated. Although this statement describes a good database management practice, it does not directly correspond to the separation of duties in openGauss. Separation of duties focuses more on the separation of permissions and responsibilities between different roles or users than the separation of responsibilities between database instances, databases, and tablespaces.\n- Option D: Database read, write, and management operations are performed by different roles or users. This is false, because it does not cover all the contents of the separation of duties. Separation of duties involves not only the separation of read/write operations and management operations, but also the separation of responsibilities of database management, data security, and audit log viewing and management.\nTherefore, the answer is B. This principle ensures the security, manageability, and transparency of database management.",

        "explanation": "For the openGauss table design, the options are analyzed as follows:\n- Option A: Planning the table structure design prevents the addition of columns and modification of column types or lengths. This is true. A good table structure is critical to database design. To maintain data stability and reduce maintenance costs, do not frequently add columns or modify the column types and lengths.\n- Option B: For Astore tables that are frequently updated, a small fill factor needs to be specified. This is true. The fillfactor attribute of a table specifies the percentage of space reserved when data is inserted into or updated in the table. For tables that are frequently updated, setting a small fill factor can reduce the frequency of page splitting and merging, thereby improving performance. Note that the value of fillfactor must be set based on the specific service scenario and performance requirements.\n- Option C: COMMENT does not need to be added. This is false. Comments are important for the maintenance and management of database objects. By adding comments, you can clearly describe the usage, functions, and restrictions of database objects, which helps other developers or database administrators better understand and use these objects.\n- Option D: Clustering or partial clustering is used to implement continuous storage of hot data and convert random I/Os into continuous I/Os. This is true. Hot data can be continuously stored through clustering or local clustering, reducing the I/O cost of scanning. Clustering is to store related data rows together so that disk I/O operations can be reduced when these rows are read, improving query performance.\nTherefore, the answers are A, B, and D.",

        "answer": "AB",
        "explanation": "In the openGauss fully-encrypted database, the method of creating encrypted tables mainly involves data table-level encryption settings, not backup tools or tablespace-level settings. The options are described as follows:\n- Option A: Use the CREATE TABLE statement to specify the encryption algorithm and key. This is true. This is the main way to create encrypted tables. In openGauss, you can use the CREATE TABLE statement to create a table and specify column-level encryption settings using specific syntax. For example, you can specify that a column is encrypted using a specific encryption algorithm and key. It involves using the ENCRYPTED WITH clause to specify encryption options.\n Option B: Use the ALTER TABLE statement to specify the encryption algorithm and key. This is true. Although the ALTER TABLE statement is usually used to modify the structure or attributes of a table, in openGauss, you can also directly use ALTER TABLE to change the encryption settings of existing columns.\n- Option C: Use the CREATE TABLESPACE statement to specify the encryption algorithm and key. This is false. The CREATE TABLESPACE statement is used to create a tablespace and does not directly involve table encryption settings. A tablespace is a physical storage area for database objects (such as tables and indexes) rather than a specified location for encryption settings.\n- Option D: Run the pg_dump command to back up the existing encrypted table and specify the encryption algorithm and key. This is false. pg_dump is a backup tool for PostgreSQL. Although openGauss is similar to PostgreSQL in some aspects, pg_dump is not a standard tool for openGauss.

This is true. The primary/standby mode uses the data synchronization and fault recovery mechanisms to ensure that the recovery point objective (RPO) and the recovery time objective (RTO) are controllable when a fault occurs. For example, by using the streaming replication technology, the standby node can synchronize data from the primary node in real time or near real time, thereby minimizing the risk of data loss.\n- Option B: Maximum reliability, performance, and availability can be achieved. This is true. The primary/standby mode improves system reliability and availability because it allows a standby node to be promoted to primary to continue providing services when the primary node is faulty.\n- Option C: Multiple failover and switchover modes are supported.

This behavior depends on the specific system implementation, but \"route\" is generally a valid command used to quickly check the status of the current routing table or obtain help information about the command itself.\n- Option B: \"route print\" is used to print the routing table in Windows. It is not a standard command in Linux OSs including openEuler. In Linux, the \"route -n\" and \"ip route\" commands are used to check the routing table. While some Linux distributions might offer aliases or extended support for \"route print\", it is not a standard Linux command.\n- Option C: \"route add default gw 192.168.1.1\" is a standard way use \"route\" to add a default gateway to the routing table, where 192.168.1.1 is the gateway IP address. This command instructs the system to send any packets with a destination IP address not in the local routing table to the gateway at 192.168.1.1.\n- Option D: \"route del -net 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0\" is used to delete a specific route from the routing table, where \"-net\" specifies the network address to be deleted and \"netmask\" specifies the subnet mask.

The following analyzes situations a WDR cannot be generated:\n- Option A: A node restarts between two snapshots. Not supported. If a node is restarted between two snapshots, the snapshot continuity and data integrity may be affected because the node restart may cause data inconsistency or other unpredictable problems. In this case, the WDR generated based on the two snapshots may be inaccurate or invalid.\n- Option B: A TRUNCATE TABLE operation is executed between two snapshots. Supported. The TRUNCATE TABLE operation deletes all data from a table, but does not affect the generation of snapshots. A snapshot captures the status of a database at a certain point in time. Truncating a table only changes the data content of the table and does not directly damage the snapshot integrity.\n- Option C: A switchover is performed between two snapshots. Not supported.

Challenges brought by data growth: The rapid growth of data volume means that larger storage space, higher processing capability, and more complex management policies are required. As the data volume increases, the sensitivity, value, and potential risks of the data increase accordingly.\n2. Importance of data security: Data security is the key to protecting user privacy, enterprise se-crets, and compliance with related laws and regulations. Any data breach or abuse may have a serious impact on enterprise reputation, user trust, and legal compliance.\n3. Challenges faced by application developers: Advanced technologies, such as encryption, ac-cess control, and audit logs, are required to protect data integrity and confidentiality. In addition to en-suring data security, system performance and response speed must be ensured to provide good user experience. As the data volume increases, data management, backup, and restoration become more complex and time-consuming. Various data protection regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, must be complied with to ensure data compliance. Employee awareness must be enhanced by training and education so that employees attach more importance to data security. The latest encryp-tion technologies, identity authentication, and access control mechanisms are required to protect data. Policies for data classification, backup, restoration, and emergency response must be formulated to ensure that data leakage or other security events can be quickly handled. Security audit and risk as-sessment are periodically performed on the system to detect potential security risks in time.\nTherefore, ensuring data security is one of the important challenges faced by application developers when data increases significantly.",

            "True",
            "False"
        ],
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The development of data management, especially the evolution from file systems to database systems, aims to reduce data redundancy, enhance data independence, and facilitate data operations.\n1. Reduce data redundancy: In a database system, data is usually stored in a structured form, avoiding storing the same data in multiple places. This not only saves storage space, but also improves data accuracy because data needs to be updated only in one place.\n2. Enhance data independence: Data independence includes physical independence and logical independence. Physical independence means an application is not affected when the physical storage structure (such as the storage location and storage mode) of data changes. Logical independence means that an application does not need to be modified when the logical structure (such as the table structure and column type) of the database changes. This independence makes the database system more flexible and maintainable.\n3. Facilitate data operations: A database system provides various data operation functions, such as query, insertion, update, and deletion. These operations can be performed using high-level languages such as SQL, eliminating the need for users to directly operate underlying data. In addition, a database system supports functions such as transaction processing and concurrency control, making data operations more reliable and secure.\nTherefore, this is true.",

        "question": "The Vim editor is an improved version of vi. Vim includes the normal mode, insert mode, and command-line mode.",
        "choices": [
            "True",
            "False"
        ],
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The Vim (Vi IMproved) editor is indeed a more powerful text editor developed from the vi editor. Vim was launched by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 as an improvement and extension of vi.\nVim operates in various modes, with the following being the most basic and frequently used:\n-\tNormal mode: In this mode, you can press shortcut keys to copy, paste, cut, search, replace text and enter other modes.\n-\tInsert mode: In this mode, you can insert and edit text. You enter insert mode from normal mode by pressing \"i\" or other designated keys.\n-\tCommand-line mode: This mode enables you to enter commands to save files, quit the editor, and search and replace text strings. It is typically accessed by typing \":\" in normal mode.\nTherefore, the statement in the question is true.",

            "True",
            "False"
        ],
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Yum is a commonly used package manager in Linux. It relies on Yum repositories (software repositories) to provide information about software packages and their dependencies. Yum repositories can be remote or local (such as those built within an internal network).\nYou can specify a Yum repository by modifying the Yum configuration file. The configuration files are usually located in the \"/etc/yum.repos.d/\" directory, with each file representing the configuration of a single Yum repository. You can open a configuration file using a text editor (such as vi or nano) and modify parameters within it, such as \"baseurl\" (URL of the repository), \"enabled\" (whether the repository is enabled), and \"gpgcheck\" (whether to perform GPG verification).\nAfter modifying a configuration file, you need to clear the Yum cache (\"yum clean all\") and regenerate it (\"yum makecache\") for the new Yum repository to take effect.\nTherefore, the statement in the question is false.",

        "question": "The advantage of the primary/standby database deployment mode is that the application does not need to increase the development workload for database faults.",
        "choices": [
            "True",
            "False"
        ],
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "In the primary/standby architecture, the standby database backs up data and does not directly participate in read and write operations of services. Clients or application systems can interact with the primary database without being aware of the existence of the standby database. Therefore, during application development, developers do not need to write additional code or logic for possible database faults.\nIn addition, the primary/standby architecture has other advantages, such as improved data fault tolerance. Data is backed up on the standby database. Therefore, even if the primary database is faulty, data will not be lost and can be restored from the standby database.\nHowever, the primary/standby architecture also has some disadvantages, such as resource waste and performance pressure concentrated on a single server. Although the standby database backs up data, it does not participate in service operations in normal cases, which wastes resources. In addition, all read and write operations are performed on the primary database, which may cause performance bottlenecks.\nTherefore, this is true.",

            "True",
            "False"
        ],
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "In a \"single-user\" system, only one user can directly use the computer system and has control over all system resources. However, openEuler allows multiple users to log in simultaneously and supports indirect access by sharing system resources.\n\"Multi-tasking\" refers to the ability of an OS to run multiple processes or threads simultaneously, achieving concurrent execution of multiple tasks. Through task scheduling by the kernel, openEuler can executable multiple processes concurrently on a single-core CPU or in parallel on a multi-core CPU. In this way, openEuler fully utilizes CPU resources and improves efficiency.\nTherefore, the statement in the question is false.",
