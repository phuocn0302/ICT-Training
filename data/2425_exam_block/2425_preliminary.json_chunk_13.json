    "question": "In the openGauss database, the primary and standby mode is automatically configured by default to ensure high data availability and fault recovery capabilities.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "False",
    "explanation": "In openGauss, primary/standby mode is **not automatically configured by default**. It must be manually set up by administrators to enable data synchronization and high availability. By default, openGauss runs as a standalone database instance.",
    "questionType": "true_false"

    "title": "Question 50 （16 Points）",
    "question": "In the openGauss database, when the GRANT statement is used to grant permissions, the granted user can immediately grant the obtained permissions to other users, provided that \"WITH GRANT OPTION\" is specified during the authorization.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "In openGauss, using the `GRANT` statement with the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause allows the recipient user to **further grant those permissions** to other users. Without this option, the permissions are not transferable.",

    "title": "Question 51 （16 Points）",
    "question": "A-Tune is an AI-powered automatic optimization system that uses intrusive system profiling to sense service workload. It matches the optimal resource model for each service and responds to service changes in real time.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "A-Tune is an AI-based automatic system optimization tool developed by openEuler. It collects system metrics, identifies workloads through profiling, and dynamically tunes system parameters for optimal performance in real time.",

    "title": "Question 52 （16 Points）",
    "question": "When using the system performance analysis tool provided by the Kunpeng DevKit to analyze the performance of C or C++ applications, you can view the function source code, assembly code, and the control flow graph of basic blocks of function assembly code.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "The performance analysis tool in the Kunpeng DevKit provides in-depth analysis for C/C++ programs, allowing developers to view **source code, assembly code**, and **control flow graphs** of function-level assembly to identify performance bottlenecks.",
