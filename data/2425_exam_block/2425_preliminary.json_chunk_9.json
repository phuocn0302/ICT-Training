    "question": "Which of the following system catalogs or views can be used to query permission information in a database?",
    "choices": [
      "A. pg_authid",
      "B. pg_shdepend",
      "C. pg_user",
      "D. information_schema.table_privileges"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The view `information_schema.table_privileges` contains detailed information about table-level privileges granted to users or roles. `pg_authid` stores authentication information (roles and passwords), `pg_shdepend` stores shared dependencies, and `pg_user` shows user account info but not privileges directly.",

    "title": "Question 34 （18 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following statements are true about common performance testing methods?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Load testing is to measure the capacity of a system by continuously increasing the load until the system performance bottlenecks or resources are saturated.",
      "B. Benchmark testing is to quantitatively and comparatively test a performance metric of a test object by designing scientific test methods, test tools, and test systems.",
      "C. Stress testing is to test the processing capacity of the system under a certain saturated state, usually set to a high CPU and memory usage rate to test the stability of the system.",
      "D. Reliability testing is to load a certain service pressure and run continuously for a period of time to test whether the system can run stably, focusing on the instantaneous pressure capacity of the system."
    ],
    "answer": "ABC",
    "explanation": "A, B, and C are correct. Load testing, benchmark testing, and stress testing all evaluate different aspects of system performance. D is incorrect because reliability testing focuses on long-term stability, not instantaneous pressure capacity.",

    "title": "Question 35 （18 Points）",
    "question": "In drive I/O subsystem tuning, which of the following options are key tuning strategies?",
    "choices": [
      "A. File system and block device management: Choose a high-performance file system and adjust block device parameters to improve I/O efficiency.",
      "B. Memory and cache optimization: Reasonably allocate memory for caching to reduce drive access frequency.",
      "C. Network storage configuration: Optimize network storage configurations such as the number of connections and bandwidth allocation to improve remote data access speed.",
      "D. I/O scheduling and prefetch strategy: Choose an appropriate I/O scheduling algorithm and implement a file prefetch strategy to improve drive access order and efficiency."
    ],
    "answer": "ABD",
    "explanation": "A, B, and D are correct. Drive I/O tuning focuses on local disk performance via filesystem selection, caching, and scheduling. Option C refers to network tuning, which is outside the drive I/O subsystem scope.",
    "questionType": "multiple"

    "title": "Question 36 （18 Points）",
    "question": "The \"-march\" option plays a crucial role for the GCC compiler on the Kunpeng platform (based on ARM architecture). Which of the following are functions of the \"-march\" option?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Defines the range of instructions that the compiler should generate.",
      "B. Determines whether to generate address-independent code.",
      "C. Optimizes the code to match the features of a specific processor.",
      "D. Specifies the architecture version of the target processor."
    ],
    "answer": "ACD",
    "explanation": "The `-march` option tells GCC which CPU architecture to target, defining available instructions (A), enabling processor-specific optimizations (C), and specifying the architecture version (D). Option B (`-fPIC`) controls address-independent code generation instead.",
    "questionType": "multiple"
