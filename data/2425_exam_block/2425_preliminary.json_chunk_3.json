    "question": "Compared with other open-source databases, openGauss has many new technical features. Which of the following statements is false?",
    "choices": [
      "A. It adopts the Mulan Permissive Software License, allowing code to be freely modified, used, and referenced.",
      "B. It provides the Ustore for frequent update scenarios.",
      "C. It provides AI-based parameter tuning and index recommendations and automatically recommends AI parameters.",
      "D. It provides the Sstore engine for frequent query scenarios."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The statement mentioning the 'Sstore engine' is false, as openGauss documentation specifies three main storage engines: Row-store (used for OLTP/frequent updates/point queries), Column-store (used for OLAP/complex queries/statistical analysis), and Memory-Optimized Table (MOT) (used for high-performance transactional/update scenarios) [1-8]. The terms 'Ustore' (B) and 'Sstore' (D) are not recognized names for the openGauss storage engines listed in the sources. However, the openGauss database is confirmed to adopt the **Mulan Permissive Software License v2**, allowing code to be freely modified, used, and referenced (A) [9, 10]. It also supports AI-based features, including optimizing parameters and automatically recommending AI parameters (C) [11-14]. Since openGauss addresses frequent query scenarios using its Row-store, Column-store, and MOT engines, the specific claim of an 'Sstore' engine is not supported by the sources.",

    "question": "Which of the following statements is true about the openGauss database architecture?",
    "choices": [
      "A. openGauss uses the client/server architecture. The client and server run in the same process.",
      "B. openGauss uses the multi-process and multi-thread architecture.",
      "C. openGauss uses the single-process and multi-thread architecture. All database operations are performed in the same process as threads.",
      "D. openGauss uses the multi-process architecture. Each database connection corresponds to an independent process."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "openGauss is a relational database that uses a client/server architecture [15, 16]. Crucially, it employs a **single-process multi-thread architecture** [15-17]. This design is advantageous because the thread startup overhead is much lower than process startup overhead [18, 19], and multiple threads running in a process share the same address space and most data [19]. When a client connects, the GaussMaster thread forks a subthread (gaussdb) to process the request [20]. This architecture allows for parallel execution of multiple closely related tasks using multiple CPUs [18].",

    "question": "In the field of integrated circuits (IC), \"die\" refers to a single, unpackaged integrated circuit chip. In the Huawei-designed Kunpeng 920 processor, what is the maximum number of cores that can be integrated into a single CPU die?",
    "choices": [
      "A. 32",
      "B. 64",
      "C. 48",
      "D. 16"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The sources explicitly mention the specifications of the Kunpeng 920 processor in the context of openGauss performance testing. The Kunpeng 920 CPU is listed as having **64 cores** and 64 threads [21, 22]. In a typical multi-core Kunpeng CPU architecture, two such chips (CPUs) together feature 128 cores [23, 24], confirming that a single processor unit (die/CPU) integrates 64 cores.",

    "title": "Question 12 （16 Points）",
    "question": "When you build open source software for the Kunpeng platform using Maven repositories, which of the following statements is false?",
    "choices": [
      "A. The local Maven repository is first queried.",
      "B. Maven repositories can be configured with proxy settings to accelerate dependency downloads from remote repositories.",
      "C. Maven repositories provide all external dependency libraries, including versions specifically optimized for the Kunpeng platform.",
      "D. When the required components are not present in the local repository, Maven downloads them from remote repositories."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The source material does not explicitly mention Maven or Maven repositories. However, based on the general principles of dependency and software package management described for openEuler utilities like DNF/YUM:\n\n*   Statements A and D reflect standard dependency resolution: when managing software packages, repositories (software sources) are utilized [1]. If packages are not locally available, they are obtained from specified software repositories [2, 3]. This typically involves querying local storage first and then fetching from a remote source if necessary. \n*   Statement B reflects general network practice: remote repositories (software sources) are typically accessed via URLs [4-6], and proxy settings (although not explicitly detailed for acceleration) are standard configurations in such environments.\n*   Statement **C** claims that Maven repositories provide **all** external dependency libraries, including versions specifically optimized for Kunpeng. Claiming that any repository provides *all* external dependency libraries is an unrealistic and overly absolute assertion, particularly concerning specific architectural optimizations (like those for Kunpeng processors mentioned elsewhere in the context of openEuler performance [7-10]). While many packages are ported (as implied by the existence of architecture-specific RPM packages like `aarch64` [11]), guaranteeing *all* external dependencies are available and optimized is generally false in real software ecosystems."
