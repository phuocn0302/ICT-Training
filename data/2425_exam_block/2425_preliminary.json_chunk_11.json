      "A. gs_check",
      "B. gs_dumpall",
      "C. gs_restore",
      "D. gs_dump"
    ],
    "answer": "B, D",
    "explanation": "`gs_dump` and `gs_dumpall` are openGauss tools used to **export (back up) data** from a database. `gs_dump` exports a single database, while `gs_dumpall` exports all databases. `gs_restore` is used for importing data, and `gs_check` is for system checking.",

      "A. INSERT",
      "B. DELETE",
      "C. ALTER",
      "D. UPDATE"
    ],
    "answer": "A, B, D",
    "explanation": "DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements manage data within tables. `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE` modify table contents. `ALTER` is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command used to change table structure.",

    "title": "Question 43 （18 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following statements are true about the single-node database architecture?",
    "choices": [
      "A. If the single-node architecture is faulty, data loss may occur.",
      "B. In the single-node architecture, applications may preempt database resources, which cannot be resolved.",
      "C. The single-node architecture has performance bottlenecks.",
      "D. The single-node architecture is not scalable and cannot cope with increasing service requirements."
    ],
    "answer": "A, C, D",
    "explanation": "In a single-node architecture, **a single database instance handles all requests**, which means faults may cause **data loss (A)**, the system can encounter **performance bottlenecks (C)**, and it is **not easily scalable (D)**. Option B is incorrect since resource contention can be mitigated through tuning.",

    "question": "Which of the following statements are true about the Samba file sharing service?",
    "choices": [
      "A. On Windows, Samba uses the NetBIOS protocol.",
      "B. A Samba server can serve as a file sharing server and a Samba client.",
      "C. Samba can be used for file sharing between Linux and Windows systems, as well as between Linux systems.",
      "D. Samba is a piece of software that enables Linux to use the Server Message Block (SMB) network communication protocol."
    ],
    "answer": "A, C, D",
    "explanation": "Samba implements the **SMB (Server Message Block)** protocol, enabling **file and printer sharing** between Linux and Windows systems. It uses **NetBIOS** for communication with Windows systems. Option B is incorrect because a Samba server and client are separate configurations, not roles performed simultaneously by one instance.",
