    "title": "Question 37 （18 Points）",
    "question": "A user is trying to port programs written in C, C++, and Go from the x86 architecture to Kunpeng. Which of the following statements are true about this process?",
    "choices": [
      "A. The generated machine language programs can directly load instructions and data into the CPU cache at runtime.",
      "B. Source code needs to be converted into machine instructions by a compiler and an assembler.",
      "C. Programs written in compiled languages need to be recompiled to adapt to the instruction set of Kunpeng processors.",
      "D. Machine language programs can run directly on any processor without additional processing."
    ],
    "answer": "BC",
    "explanation": "When porting applications from x86 to Kunpeng (ARM architecture), **source code must be compiled and assembled** into machine instructions (B). Since compiled languages depend on CPU instruction sets, **programs must be recompiled** for the Kunpeng architecture (C). Machine code (D) is CPU-specific, and (A) is not accurate about compilation behavior.",

    "title": "Question 38 （18 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following modes are supported by Linux Virtual Server (LVS)?",
    "choices": [
      "A. TUN mode",
      "B. DR mode",
      "C. KONG mode",
      "D. NAT mode"
    ],
    "answer": "ABD",
    "explanation": "LVS (Linux Virtual Server) supports **three forwarding modes**: NAT (Network Address Translation), DR (Direct Routing), and TUN (IP Tunneling). 'KONG mode' does not exist.",

    "title": "Question 39 （18 Points）",
    "question": "In openEuler, Vim is in normal mode and the cursor is at line 5 of a file. Which of the following commands move the cursor to the first line?",
    "choices": [
      "A. 1G",
      "B. gg",
      "C. 4k",
      "D. G"
    ],
    "answer": "AB",
    "explanation": "In Vim normal mode, `gg` and `1G` both move the cursor to the **first line**. The command `4k` moves the cursor up four lines, and `G` moves to the **last line** of the file.",

    "title": "Question 40 （18 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following software package installation methods are available in openEuler?",
    "choices": [
      "A. \"rpm\"",
      "B. \"yum\" or \"dnf\"",
      "C. Directly executing binary installation files",
      "D. Source code compilation"
    ],
    "answer": "ABD",
    "explanation": "openEuler supports multiple installation methods: **rpm** for manual package management, **yum/dnf** for automatic dependency resolution, and **source code compilation** for custom builds. Option C is not typical since most software in Linux is not installed by directly executing binaries.",
