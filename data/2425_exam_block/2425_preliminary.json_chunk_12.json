    "title": "Question 45 （18 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following statements are true about Linux commands?",
    "choices": [
      "A. \"du\" displays the drive usage of a specified directory.",
      "B. \"mount\" is used to mount devices.",
      "C. \"umount\" is used to unmount devices.",
      "D. \"fdisk -l\" displays drive partition details."
    ],
    "answer": "B, C, D",
    "explanation": "The `mount` command mounts devices, `umount` unmounts them, and `fdisk -l` lists partition information. The `du` command shows **disk usage**, not drive usage, so option A is incorrect.",
    "questionType": "multiple"
  },
  {
    "title": "Question 46 （16 Points）",
    "question": "Cron scheduled tasks usually include \">/dev/null 2>&1\" at the end.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "Adding `>/dev/null 2>&1` redirects both standard output and error messages to `/dev/null`, effectively discarding them. This prevents cron jobs from sending unnecessary output or emails to the user.",
    "questionType": "true_false"

    "question": "A user group can have multiple users, but a user can only belong to a single user group.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "False",
    "explanation": "In Linux, a user belongs to one **primary group** but can also be part of **multiple supplementary groups**, allowing flexible permission management.",
    "questionType": "true_false"
  },
  {
    "title": "Question 48 （16 Points）",
    "question": "PXE booting or virtual CD-ROM drives are common methods for batch installation of openEuler.",
    "choices": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "For batch deployment of openEuler, administrators commonly use **PXE network boot** or **virtual CD-ROM drives** in virtualized environments for automated installation.",
