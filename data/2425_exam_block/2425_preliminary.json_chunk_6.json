    "question": "If a database administrator wants to interrupt a query that has been running for a long time, which of the following views can be used to obtain the process ID of the session to help the database administrator perform this operation?",
    "choices": [
      "A. PG_STAT_USER",
      "B. PG_USER",
      "C. PG_STATS",
      "D. PG_STAT_ACTIVITY"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The view used to obtain running query statements and their associated PIDs (Process IDs) is **PG_STAT_ACTIVITY** [1-3]. A database administrator can view the database names, users performing queries, query status, and the corresponding PIDs through this view [2, 3]. To cancel queries that have been running for a long time, the database administrator uses the `PG_TERMINATE_BACKEND` function, which operates based on the thread ID obtained from this view [2, 4, 5].",

    "question": "Which of the following files is used to set the openGauss client authentication policy?",
    "choices": [
      "A. pg_hba.conf",
      "B. postgresql.conf",
      "C. pg_ident.conf",
      "D. pg_ctl.conf"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The file used to set the openGauss client authentication policy is **pg_hba.conf** [6-8]. This file is the Host-based access authentication configuration file, which stores crucial authentication information such as databases, users, IP address segments, and encryption modes [6, 7, 9]. The system checks client connection requests against the records in the `pg_hba.conf` file sequentially during authentication [7, 10]. By contrast, `postgresql.conf` stores general configuration parameters like listening address and memory allocation [11], and `pg_ident.conf` stores user mapping information (OS user to database user) for client authentication [6, 12].",

    "question": "In Linux, which of the following statements is true about the function of the \"chown\" command?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Modifies the default home directory of a user.",
      "B. Modifies the read, write, and execute permissions on a file or directory.",
      "C. Modifies the link attributes of a file or directory, specifying if it is a hard or soft link.",
      "D. Modifies the user and user group to which a file or directory belongs."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The `chown` command is used to **modify a file owner and owner group** [13]. It changes the owner of a specified file to a particular user or group [14, 15]. Only the system administrator (root) has the permission to run this command [14-16]. Option B describes the function of the `chmod` command [13, 16].",

    "question": "A virtual machine (VM) has 2 GB of memory. What is the recommended swap partition size when openEuler is installed on the VM?",
    "choices": [
      "A. 512 MB",
      "B. 1 GB",
      "C. 2 GB",
      "D. 4 GB"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The swap partition is utilized when physical memory is insufficient [17]. According to the recommended swap sizes provided for openEuler systems, if the RAM size is **less than or equal to 2 GB, the recommended swap size is **2x the RAM size** [18]. Therefore, for a VM with 2 GB of memory, the recommended swap size is 4GB [18, 19]. This recommendation is also consistently reflected in the lab guides, where a `swap` partition is configured with 4 GiB capacity [20].",
