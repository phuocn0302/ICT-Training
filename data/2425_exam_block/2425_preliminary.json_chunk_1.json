    "question": "Which command is used to view open files in openEuler?",
    "choices": [
      "A. find",
      "B. lsof",
      "C. ls",
      "D. mount"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The command typically used in Linux environments to list open files is `lsof`. The other options are documented for different purposes: `find` is used to search for files [1, 2], `ls` is used to view file and directory lists [3-5], and `mount` is used to query or configure mounting information [6-8]. Although the specific definition of the `lsof` command is not provided in the supplied texts, it is the standard utility for viewing open files among the choices listed.",

    "title": "Question 2 （16 Points）",
    "question": "Which statement is false about single quotes in shell scripting?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Single quotes escaped with a backslash can appear within single quotes.",
      "B. Single quotes cannot appear within single quotes.",
      "C. Variables within single quotes are invalid.",
      "D. Any character within single quotes will be output as is."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The statement that 'Single quotes escaped with a backslash can appear within single quotes' is false because strings enclosed in single quotation marks cannot contain extra single quotation marks, even if escape characters are used for them [9]. The sources confirm that any characters within single quotation marks are output without any changes (D) [9], and variables within single quotes are invalid (C) [9]. Consequently, single quotes cannot appear within single quotes (B) [9].",

    "title": "Question 3 （16 Points）",
    "question": "In openEuler, what is the maximum number of primary partitions allowed on a drive?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Three",
      "B. Unlimited",
      "C. One",
      "D. Four"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "When partitioning a drive using the Master Boot Record (MBR) scheme, which is a traditional partitioning scheme discussed in the context of openEuler storage, the total number of primary partitions and extended partitions cannot exceed four [10]. Specifically, a drive can have a maximum of **four primary partitions** [11-13].",

    "title": "Question 4 （16 Points）",
    "question": "Which statement is false about the \"kill\" command?",
    "choices": [
      "A. \"kill -19\" pauses the process.",
      "B. \"kill -15\" unconditionally stops the process without terminating it.",
      "C. \"kill -1\" suspends the process.",
      "D. \"kill -9\" forcibly terminates the process."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The statement is false because signal 15 (TERM) is a **Termination** signal [14, 15]. Unlike signal 9 (KILL), which forcibly terminates a process (D) [14-16], signal 15 can be caught or ignored by processes [16], meaning it is **not unconditional**. Furthermore, termination implies stopping the process and exiting. Signal 1 is HUP (Hangup) [14, 15], which is not suspension (C). Signal 19 is described as CONT (Continue executing, if stopped) in one source [14] (making A false) or STOP in another [15] (making A true, as stopping is a form of pausing), but B is definitively false regarding its unconditional nature and goal.",
