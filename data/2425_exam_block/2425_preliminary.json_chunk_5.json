    "question": "While you edit a text file using Vim in openEuler, which command can be used in normal mode to forcibly save and exit the file?",
    "choices": [
      "A. :wq.force",
      "B. :wq-f",
      "C. :wq",
      "D. :wq!"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The standard command to save and exit a file in Vim is **:wq** [1-4]. However, the command used to **forcibly** save and exit (such as when the file is read-only) is **:wq!** [1]. The exclamation mark (!) forces the operation, allowing the user to overwrite the file even if restrictions are set, provided the user has file system permission to do so [5].",

    "question": "In openEuler, configuration files are used to manage network information for network devices. Where are these configuration files stored by default?",
    "choices": [
      "A. /etc/profile",
      "B. /etc/passwd",
      "C. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts",
      "D. /etc/systemd"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The default configuration path for network devices in openEuler is explicitly documented as **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/** [6]. Individual Network Interface Card (NIC) configuration files are stored here, named in the format `ifcfg-*` [7].",

    "title": "Question 19 （16 Points）",
    "question": "Which of the following statements about partitioned tables in openGauss is true?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Partitioned tables cannot be joined with ordinary tables.",
      "B. Tables can be partitioned only by range.",
      "C. A partitioned table is a large table divided into multiple small and independent physical blocks based on a certain rule for storage. The physical blocks are logically considered whole.",
      "D. After a partitioned table is created, partitions cannot be added to or deleted from the table."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Statement C accurately defines data partitioning in openGauss: it is an operation that **splits table data into multiple, non-overlapping partitions** (physical blocks) based on a specified policy [8-10]. This division provides benefits such as high query performance and easy maintenance [8, 9, 11]. Statement B is false because openGauss supports range partitioning, list partitioning, and hash partitioning [12-15]. Statement D is false because commands exist to modify partitioned tables, such as `ALTER TABLE PARTITION` [16].",

      "A. \\dn",
      "B. \\s",
      "C. \\l",
      "D. \\d"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The gsql meta-command used to **list the databases** available in the database system is **\\l** [17-20]. Other meta-commands serve different purposes, such as \\dn for listing schemas [21, 22] and \\d or \\d+ for viewing tables, relations, or indexes [18, 22-24].",
